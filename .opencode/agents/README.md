## Using Agents

See [guide.md](guide.md) for detailed information about creating, configuring, and using subagents effectively.

## Benefits of Subagents

1. **Clean Context Isolation** - Each subagent starts with a fresh context window
2. **Parallel Processing** - Multiple subagents can work simultaneously
3. **Specialized Expertise** - Agents are optimized for specific tasks
4. **Consistent Results** - Predictable behavior across sessions
