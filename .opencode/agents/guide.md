# OpenCode Subagents: A Comprehensive Guide

OpenCode subagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific tasks independently, enabling more efficient problem-solving through task-specific configurations with customized system prompts, tools, and separate context windows. These pre-configured AI personalities can be automatically or explicitly invoked to handle specialized work like code review, debugging, or data analysis, operating with their own clean context to prevent conversation pollution while maintaining access to OpenCode's toolset.

## Understanding subagents and their architecture

Subagents fundamentally change how OpenCode approaches complex tasks by introducing a delegation model. Rather than handling every task in a single conversation thread, OpenCode can identify when a specialized subagent would be more effective and delegate the work accordingly. Each subagent operates as an independent entity with its own context window, preventing the main conversation from becoming cluttered with task-specific details while allowing for deeper, more focused analysis.

The technical architecture relies on **Markdown files with YAML frontmatter** stored in specific directories. Project-level subagents live in `.opencode/agents/` and are shared with your team, while user-level subagents in `~/.config/opencode/agents/` remain available across all your projects. When OpenCode encounters a task matching a subagent's expertise area, it passes the relevant context to that subagent, which processes the request independently and returns results to the main thread.

This separation of concerns offers several advantages. The main conversation maintains clarity and focus while subagents handle specialized work. Each subagent starts with a clean context, ensuring consistent behavior and preventing cross-contamination of different task types. The system also supports **granular tool access control**, allowing administrators to limit subagents to only the tools necessary for their specific purposes.

## Creating and configuring effective subagents

Getting started with subagents requires just a few steps. The quickest approach uses the `/agents` command to open an interactive interface where you can create, edit, and manage your subagents. When creating a new subagent, OpenCode can generate an initial configuration based on your description, which you can then refine to match your specific needs.

The configuration format is straightforward:

```markdown
---
name: your-sub-agent-name
description: Natural language description of when this subagent should be invoked
tools:
  Read: true
  Grep: true
  Glob: true
---
Your subagent's system prompt goes here.
This defines the subagent's role, capabilities, and approach to solving problems.
```

The **name field** requires lowercase letters and hyphens only, serving as the unique identifier. The **description field** plays a crucial role in automatic delegation - OpenCode uses this natural language description to determine when to invoke the subagent. Including phrases like "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED" increases the likelihood of automatic delegation.

Tool configuration deserves special attention. By default, subagents inherit all tools available to the main OpenCode instance, including MCP server tools. However, following the principle of least privilege, you should limit subagents to only the tools they need. For a code reviewer subagent, granting just Read and Bash tools prevents accidental modifications while still allowing thorough analysis. In frontmatter, that means using a boolean `tools` map such as `Read: true` and `Bash: true`, or omitting `tools` entirely to inherit everything.

## Practical examples demonstrate subagent power

Consider a code reviewer subagent designed to catch bugs and enforce best practices. Its configuration might specify access to only Read and Bash tools, with a system prompt instructing it to analyze for security vulnerabilities, performance implications, and adherence to coding standards. When you make changes to your codebase, OpenCode automatically delegates review tasks to this specialized agent, which returns detailed feedback with specific improvement suggestions.

A debugger subagent takes a different approach, requiring Read, Write, and Bash tools to investigate errors and implement fixes. Its system prompt emphasizes systematic diagnosis, root cause analysis, and practical solutions. When OpenCode encounters an error message or unexpected behavior, it delegates to this debugging specialist, which can modify code to test hypotheses and verify solutions.

**Data analysis subagents** showcase another powerful pattern. Configured with access to database tools and specialized libraries, these subagents handle complex SQL queries, statistical analysis, or visualization tasks. Their system prompts can include specific instructions for your organization's data warehouse, preferred analysis methods, and reporting formats.

The true power emerges when multiple subagents work together. A feature development workflow might involve a requirements analyst subagent breaking down specifications, a code generator subagent implementing the solution, a reviewer subagent checking the implementation, and a test writer subagent creating comprehensive test cases. Each operates independently but contributes to a cohesive development process.

## Best practices maximize subagent effectiveness

Successful subagent implementation follows several key principles. **Focus each subagent on a single responsibility** rather than creating overly broad agents. A subagent specialized in Python code review will perform better than a general "code helper" trying to handle multiple languages and tasks.

Write detailed system prompts that provide clear guidance. Include specific examples of desired behavior, constraints the subagent should follow, and the reasoning process it should employ. The more context and direction you provide, the more consistently the subagent will meet your expectations. Remember that subagents start fresh with each invocation, so the system prompt must contain all necessary instructions.

Version control integration proves essential for team environments. By checking your `.opencode/agents/` directory into your repository, team members can benefit from and improve shared subagents. This collaborative approach leads to increasingly refined and effective subagents over time. Consider establishing team conventions for subagent naming and documentation to maintain consistency.

**Performance optimization** requires balancing context gathering with efficiency. While subagents need sufficient information to complete their tasks, excessive context retrieval adds latency. Structure your system prompts to guide subagents toward the most relevant information quickly. Similarly, limit tool access not just for security but also to help subagents focus on appropriate actions.

## Integration enhances the OpenCode ecosystem

Subagents integrate seamlessly with other OpenCode features, amplifying their utility. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration allows subagents to access external tools and services, from database connections to API integrations. When configured properly, a subagent can query your production databases, interact with third-party services, or access specialized development tools.

The hooks system enables sophisticated automation workflows. When a subagent completes its task, the `SubagentStop` hook event fires, allowing you to trigger additional actions like notifications, logging, or subsequent processing steps. This event-driven architecture supports complex, multi-stage workflows that adapt based on subagent outputs.

Within IDE integrations, subagents maintain full functionality. Whether you're using VS Code or JetBrains IDEs, subagents respond to the same commands and shortcuts. They can access selected code, view diffs, and interact with your development environment just like the main OpenCode instance. This consistency ensures a smooth development experience regardless of your preferred tools.

## Troubleshooting ensures smooth operation

When subagents don't behave as expected, systematic troubleshooting helps identify issues quickly. The `/agents` command provides comprehensive management capabilities, showing all available subagents, their configurations, and which version takes precedence when duplicates exist. This interface also allows real-time editing and testing of subagent configurations.

**Common issues often stem from unclear descriptions or overly restrictive tool access**. If a subagent isn't being invoked automatically, refine its description to be more specific and action-oriented. Include concrete trigger phrases that match how you naturally describe tasks. For tool access problems, verify that all necessary tools are listed in the configuration or remove the tools field entirely to inherit all available tools.

Performance issues typically arise from inefficient context gathering or overly broad system prompts. Monitor subagent execution to identify bottlenecks. Consider breaking complex subagents into multiple specialized agents that can work more efficiently. Remember that each subagent invocation starts fresh, so minimize the amount of context that must be gathered repeatedly.

## Conclusion

OpenCode subagents represent a paradigm shift in AI-assisted development, moving from monolithic conversations to specialized, focused agents that excel at specific tasks. By understanding their architecture, following configuration best practices, and integrating them effectively with your workflow, you can dramatically improve both the efficiency and quality of your development process. The key lies in thoughtful design - creating focused subagents with clear responsibilities, appropriate tool access, and detailed guidance that enables them to consistently deliver exceptional results. As you build your library of specialized subagents, you're essentially creating a team of AI experts, each bringing deep expertise to their domain while working together seamlessly to tackle complex development challenges.
